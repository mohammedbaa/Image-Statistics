# calculate-the-image-statistics-for-a-gray-scale-image
description of the different image statistics that can be calculated for a grayscale image:

Mean: The mean pixel value of a grayscale image represents the average brightness of the image. It is calculated by summing up all the pixel values in the image and dividing it by the total number of pixels.

Median: The median pixel value of a grayscale image represents the middle value in the sorted list of all the pixel values. It is a useful measure of central tendency, especially when the image has outliers or extreme values.

Standard deviation: The standard deviation of pixel values in a grayscale image represents the amount of variation or spread of the pixel values from the mean value. It is calculated by taking the square root of the variance, which is the average of the squared differences between each pixel value and the mean.

Minimum and maximum pixel values: The minimum pixel value of a grayscale image represents the darkest pixel in the image, while the maximum pixel value represents the brightest pixel in the image. These values can provide information about the contrast and dynamic range of the image.
